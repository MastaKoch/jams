# Jams
To create a Reddit style Educational Resource application with MERN (Mongo DB/Mongoose, Express, React, and Node) while launching the application on Heroku. By utilizing components, managing components states, importing packages, and responding to user events, we will separate the application's UI to allow for a highly dynamic and resource friendly user experience.

## Project Description

Welcome to JAMS: Helping children find their voice since 2021. JAMS is an application that is designed for kids to use in a school setting. Like Reddit, it gives users the ability to post on “threads” on various topics. In JAMS, the topics can be on virtually anything educational (Science, language arts, social studies, math, etc.). 

The team at JAMS believe this application is indispensable; many children in schools all over the world don’t feel confident when it comes to speaking up and voicing their opinions in front of their peers. With JAMS, every child has a voice. 


## User Story

* As a user, be able to sign up for an account and login to view landing page with your newly created username in navigation bar. Be able to interact with the site's landing page and Education Resource information dynamically.

#### The user should be able to:

  * Sign up for an account.
  * Log in with new account information and be routed to the landing page.
  * Read information on landing pages and determine whether to navigate to the Education Resource page.
  * Once on the resource page, read information and explore the React Educational Resource Table links.
  * When finished reviewing resources, navigate back to the landing page.

## Demo Features:
* The following image and gif shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Summary
* In this project we will create a user responsive UI application using React.js to access a Reddit style Education Resource application. The database for the application uses Mongo DB and Atlas cloud base sharing that will allow users to create signup for login accounts and access resources stored in our React table. Users will be able to dynamically respond with the resources and leave reviews stating their experiences. With future development, the users will be able to view previously stored information from their accounts.
